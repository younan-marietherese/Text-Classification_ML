# Text Classification with Machine Learning

This project focuses on **Text Classification**, a common task in natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is to categorize text into predefined labels or classes. Using traditional machine learning algorithms, this project demonstrates how to preprocess text data and build models that can accurately classify the text into categories.

## Project Overview
Text classification is a crucial task in NLP, used in applications like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. In this project, we preprocess text data, extract features, and train machine learning models to classify the text into categories. The project explores different machine learning algorithms such as **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to find the best model for text classification.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess text data, including cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- Train machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM for text classification.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing model.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the models and handling text data.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models and evaluating them.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and performance analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled text samples, where each text entry is assigned a category. It could be a dataset related to sentiment analysis, spam classification, or news article categorization. You can use any publicly available dataset from platforms like **Kaggle** or **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
   - Clean the text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
   - Tokenize the text into words and apply **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer** to convert text into numerical features.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Train different machine learning models such as:
     - **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
     - **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification.
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful model for linear and non-linear classification.
   - Perform cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters and improve generalization.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-score**
   - Use confusion matrices to analyze the performance of each model.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of all the models and select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - Visualize the results using bar plots or confusion matrices.
